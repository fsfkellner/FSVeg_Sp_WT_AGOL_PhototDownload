# FSVeg_Sp_WT_AGOL_PhototDownload
An ERSI .pyt Toolbox designed to download only the points that have photo attachements
from the Region 1 FSVeg Spatial Walk Through Survey123 Form. 

This tool box leverages Python 2.x and the ESRI REST API as the FS data center
still uses ArcGIS Desktop which ships with Python 2.
