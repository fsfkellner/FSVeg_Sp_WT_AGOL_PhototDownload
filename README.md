# FSVeg_Sp_WT_AGOL_PhototDownload
An ERSI .pyt Toolbox designed to download only the points 
that have photo attachements from the Forest Service Region 1 
FSVeg Spatial Walk Through Survey123 Form. 

This tool box leverages Python 2.x and the ESRI REST API as the
Forest Service data center still uses ArcGIS Desktop 
which ships with Python 2.
